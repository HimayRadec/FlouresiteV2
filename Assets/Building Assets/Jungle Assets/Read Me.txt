Do not forget to add the diffusion profiles from package to the Diffusion Profile List in HDRP!!!

If you do not do it, you will experimenting a "black screen" or the vegetation will not render property 

The easiest way to do it is selecting any Vegetation material, and in the material properties (down in the diffusion profile box) there must be a FIX button.
